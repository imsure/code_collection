A computer controlled Snake game implemented in C++ based on a simple AI
========================================================================

The implementation is described in chapter 5 of Stanford CS106L "C++ Programming Laboratory"'s course reader:

This is great book, BTW. It is free and worth reading! ^_^

To compile:

$ g++ snake.cpp

To run:

$ ./a.out

After running, you should specify level0.txt as the filename of the map
at the command line prompt.
