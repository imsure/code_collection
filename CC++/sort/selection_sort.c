  -- implementation of selection sort

  -- description of selection sort:
  From wikipedia:
  It is specially an in-place comparison,
  with O(nÂ²) time complexity, make it inefficient for large lists,
  and generally performs worse than the similar insertion sort.
  However, it is noted for its simplicity, and also has performance
  advantages over more complicated algorithms in certain situations,
  particularly where auxiliary memory is limited.

  It outperforms bubble sort.

  -- algorithm:
  N := number of elements need to sort
  A := array in which elements are stored
  For i from 0 to N-2 Do
    Find the smallest element among [i, N-1]
    Swap positions between element i and the smallest element
  END
