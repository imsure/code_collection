The sorting program I wrote is capable of applying insertion sort,
merge sort, heap sort and quick sort to data set contains intergers.

To get help of how to use the program:
java -jar MySort.jar -h

Here are some examples:
1. To run insertion sort against ds_random.txt,
java -jar MySort.jar i ds_random.txt

2. To run the four sort algorithm together:
java -jar MySort.jar ihmq ds_random.txt

The outputs required by the assignment will be generated under output folder.
Beyond the required output, the program is also caplable of generating a combined
statistics report file. For example, for the example 2 above, there will be a file
named ihmq_ds_random.txt.combined generated in which stats displayed for all 4 sort
algorithm and sorted ascendingly by exection time to make it easier to compare and
draw conclusion.
